# TODO & Future Improvements

This document tracks all planned enhancements, missing features, and future improvements for the Bookmarks-Aware MCP Server.

## Search Engine Enhancements

- [ ] **Semantic search**: Enhance the search engine to use semantic search with embeddings for more intelligent bookmark matching
- [ ] **Full-text search**: Add full-text search of bookmark content (not just URLs and titles)
- [ ] **Advanced ranking algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated ranking algorithms to improve search result relevance

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Multiple profile support**: Support multiple Chrome profiles (currently uses the default profile only)
- [ ] **Bookmark descriptions**: Scrape/bookmark content to generate descriptions for bookmarks (currently uses the URL as the description fallback)
- [ ] **Multiple bookmark sources**: Support for multiple bookmark sources beyond Chrome (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Edge)
